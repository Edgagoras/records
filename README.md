# Code Review 8 

This branch of the records repo is behind the master branch, and frozen 
at a point where the code has the basic utilities that were requested as part
of Assignment 8. Compare your code to the code in this branch to see how 
the implementations varied. 

Follow the further instructions in the [code-review directory](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/8-python-web/tree/master/Code-Review) to do the next step
of your code review, which is to read and interpret the extended code (v.0.2)
of the records library, and to update your repository to match it.
